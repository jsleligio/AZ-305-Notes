# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)

## Azure Backup
- **Backup for VMs**: Automated backup of Azure VMs.
- **Backup for SQL Databases**: Point-in-time restore, long-term retention.

## Azure Site Recovery (ASR)
- **Disaster Recovery**: Replication of workloads across Azure regions.
- **Failover**: Manual and automated failover to secondary regions.

## High Availability (HA)
- **Designing HA Architectures**:
  - **Availability Zones**: Physically separated data centers within a region.
  - **Geo-redundancy**: Distributing resources across different geographic regions.
  
## Design Considerations:
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) definitions.
- Backup and recovery strategy for VMs, data, and applications.
